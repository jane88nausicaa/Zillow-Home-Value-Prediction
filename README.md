# Zillowâ€™s Home Value Prediction (Zestimate)
## DataSet Source
- All the properties with their home features for 2016: properties_2016.csv
- The training set with transactions from 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2016: train_2016_v2.csv
## Model Selection Random Forest Regression
To select model, we first performed an inner join between train_2016_v2.csv and properties_2016.csv locally, to select the home features of the properties that were sold from 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2016.

The python script is as follow:

# Script filename: src/join.py
def join():
    """
    Join the training set and properties data.
    """
    properties = "properties_2016.csv"
    training = "train_2016_v2.csv"
    result = "trainingData.csv"

    pids = dict()

    with open(training) as tf:
        for line in tf:
            pid, logerror, tdate = line.split(",")
            if pid in pids:
                pids[pid] = [(logerror,tdate[:7])] + pids[pid]
            else:
                pids[pid] = [(logerror,tdate[:7])]

    combine = lambda a,b,c: a + ',' +  b + ',' + c + '\n'

    with open(properties) as pf:
        for line in pf:
            pid = line.split(",")[0]
            nline = line.rstrip()
            if pid in pids:
                with open(result, "a") as rf:
                    for l,d in pids[pid]:
                        rf.write(combine(nline,d,l))
